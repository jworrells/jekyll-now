I've been doing IT since 1995.

Work experience:

* 1995-2000, 3Com, Configuration Management / Sysadmin

* 2000-2001, Intel, Sysadmin

* 2001-2002, NextGig, Sysadmin

* 2002-2003, AristoMed, Sysadmin

* 2003-2006, Intermountain Health Care, Web Operations / Security

* 2006-2008, Unisys, Cybersecurity

* 2008-2012, Defense Information Systems Agency, Cybersecurity

* 2012-Present, United States Air Force, Cybersecurity

I'm also in the United States Navy Reserve. I'm a Chief Information Systems Technician. I originally enlisted in 2002.

I am a big fan of Unix and Linux. I enjoy hacking on Raspberry Pis (I have 6 of them at present). I do a lot of research on new technologies and enjoy doing small projects to learn about new things. I don't stick to any one thing for very long - many of my projects are abandoned rather quickly.
