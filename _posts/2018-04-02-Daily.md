title: Secure DNS from Cloudflare?
---

I read an article today about [1.1.1.1](https://1.1.1.1), a new DNS infrastructure run by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com). It's a globally distributed DNS service run on top of Cloudflare's global network. On the surface, it looks like a decent competitor to Google's or OpenDNS' public DNS.
